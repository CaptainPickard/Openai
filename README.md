# Openai
 Python script for having conversations with OpenAI in the console.
 
 In future iterations I would like to convert this into its own feature of VS code. Ideally, providing a console window running the open dialogue with OpenAI. Having OpenAI available for code suggestions and overall workflow convenience, inside of the IDE experience.

# ai_created Folder
The ai_created file is a library of code suggestion created by Openai. Please leave a push of some interesting code suggestions you received while using Openai.
