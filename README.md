# Openai
 Python script for having conversations with OpenAI in teh console.
 
 In future itterations I would like to convert this into its own feature of VS code. Ideally, providing a console window running the open diolouge with OpenAI. Having OpenAI available for code suggestions and overall workflow convenince, inside of the IDE experience.
